**Software Defined GPU™** - Software layer to Orchestrate, Virtualize and Schedule ML workloads  
**Value:** ML Developer Productivity, GPU Capacity Expansion and Cost Savings (ROI)

## Overview

Exostellar's Software Defined GPU™ addresses the critical AI infrastructure bottleneck through intelligent software orchestration. Our platform transforms how organizations manage and optimize their GPU resources, delivering unprecedented efficiency and cost savings.

### The AI Infrastructure Challenge

Modern AI infrastructure faces a critical bottleneck cycle:

- **Lack of Visibility** - Infrastructure teams lack real-time insights into utilization and costs
- **Long GPU Wait Times** - Developers wait hours, weeks, or months for GPU availability  
- **No Cross-Cluster Pooling** - Stranded GPUs across K8s clusters with no aggregation or reuse
- **Underutilized GPUs** - Static allocation leads to wasted capacity and overprovisioning

### Maximizing Infrastructure Investment

**TCO Impact for 18,000 H100 Cluster:**
- Hardware Investment: $540M (18,000 × $30K)
- Traditional GPU Utilization: 20-30%
- Annual TCO Waste: $150-200M (power, cooling, opportunity cost)

**Exostellar Optimization Results:**
- Same $540M Investment
- Effective Capacity: 4-8x improvement  
- Virtual GPUs: 72K-144K
- Compute Value: $1.5-2.1B
- **Annual Value Creation: $200-400M from existing AI infrastructure**

## High-Level Architecture

Exostellar's Software Defined GPU™ consists of three integrated components that work together to maximize GPU infrastructure efficiency:

### GPU Flex
**Instant allocation of right-sized resources**

- **Dynamic GPU Fractionalization** - Split physical GPUs into multiple virtual instances based on actual workload requirements
- **Vendor Agnostic** - Works across NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel GPU architectures  
- **Compute/Memory Slicing** - Independently allocate GPU compute and memory resources for optimal utilization

### GPU ClusterOps  
**Easy resource sharing across multiple org/teams**

- **Resource Pooling and Queuing** - Aggregate GPU resources across clusters for efficient allocation
- **Hierarchical Quota Management** - Multi-level resource governance aligned with organizational structure
- **Priority and Preemption** - Intelligent workload prioritization and resource reclamation
- **Topology-Aware Scheduling** - Optimize placement based on network and hardware topology

### GPU IQ
**Autonomously right-size workloads**

- **Autonomous Right-Sizing** - AI-powered resource allocation that adapts to workload patterns
- **Smart Scheduling and Bin-Packing** - Optimize resource utilization through intelligent workload placement  
- **AI-Assist Insight** - Machine learning-driven recommendations for infrastructure optimization

## Concept

### Breakthrough: Compute + Memory Slicing

Current orchestration treats AI workloads as homogeneous "black boxes" and fails to differentiate between fundamentally different resource patterns:

**AI Workload Resource Patterns:**
- **Compute-Intensive Phases** - Matrix multiplication, convolutions
- **Memory-Intensive Phases** - Embedding lookups, attention mechanism  
- **I/O-Bound Phases** - Checkpoint saving, data loading

**Traditional Approach Limitations:**
- Fixed GPU allocation per workload
- Over-provisioning to handle peak demands
- Significant resource waste during idle periods
- No differentiation between compute and memory requirements

**Exostellar's Software Defined GPU™ Solution:**
- **Dynamic Allocation** - GPU resources allocated on-demand based on actual usage patterns
- **Fractional GPUs** - Multiple workloads can share a single physical GPU intelligently
- **Independent Resource Slicing** - Separate compute and memory allocation based on workload phase
- **Elastic Scaling** - Resources automatically scale up or down with workload requirements

### Key Benefits
- **4-8x Capacity Improvement** - Increase effective GPU capacity through intelligent virtualization
- **$200-400M Annual Value Creation** - Maximize ROI from existing AI infrastructure investment
- **Real-Time Optimization** - Continuous workload analysis and resource right-sizing
- **Developer Productivity** - Eliminate GPU wait times and resource bottlenecks
