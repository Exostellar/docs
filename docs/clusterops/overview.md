# ClusterOps Overview

ClusterOps provides intelligent multi-cluster orchestration with advanced scheduling, quota management, and topology-aware resource allocation.

## Key Features

- **Multi-cluster Management**: Unified control across multiple Kubernetes clusters
- **Intelligent Scheduling**: Workload placement optimization across clusters
- **Quota Management**: Fair resource allocation and usage controls
- **Topology-aware Placement**: Network and hardware topology optimization
- **Inference Queues**: Specialized queuing for inference workloads

## Architecture

ClusterOps consists of:
1. **Control Plane**: Central management and decision making
2. **Cluster Agents**: Local cluster monitoring and execution
3. **Scheduler**: Intelligent workload placement engine
4. **Quota Controller**: Resource allocation and enforcement

## Benefits

- **Improved Utilization**: Optimal resource distribution across clusters
- **Cost Optimization**: Workload placement based on cost and performance
- **High Availability**: Automatic failover and load balancing
- **Simplified Management**: Single pane of glass for multi-cluster operations
