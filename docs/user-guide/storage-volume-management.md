# Storage Volume Management

Manage persistent storage volumes for your workspaces and applications in the Exostellar platform.

## Overview

Storage volumes provide persistent data storage that survives workspace restarts and can be shared across multiple workspaces. Proper storage management is essential for data persistence and collaboration.

## Types of Storage Volumes

### Personal Volumes
- Private storage accessible only to the owner
- Ideal for personal files and configurations
- Automatically mounted to user workspaces

### Shared Volumes
- Accessible by multiple users within a project
- Enable collaboration and data sharing
- Configurable access permissions

### Project Volumes
- Dedicated storage for project-wide data
- Managed at the project level
- Inherit project access controls

## Creating Storage Volumes

### Prerequisites
- Access to a project with storage creation permissions
- Understanding of storage requirements and performance needs
- Available storage quota in your project

### Volume Creation Steps

1. **Navigate to Storage**
   - Access your project dashboard
   - Click on "Storage" or "Volumes"
   - Select "Create Volume"

2. **Configure Volume Settings**
   ```
   Volume Name: my-data-volume
   Size: 100GB
   Type: SSD/HDD
   Access Mode: ReadWriteOnce/ReadWriteMany
   ```

3. **Set Access Permissions**
   - Define who can access the volume
   - Set read/write permissions
   - Configure sharing settings

## Storage Operations

### Mounting Volumes
```bash
# Volumes are automatically mounted in workspaces at:
/mnt/volumes/volume-name

# Or manually mount using:
mount /dev/disk/by-label/volume-name /path/to/mountpoint
```

### Volume Management
- **Resize Volumes** - Expand storage capacity as needed
- **Backup Volumes** - Create point-in-time backups
- **Clone Volumes** - Create copies for testing or development
- **Share Volumes** - Configure multi-user access

### Data Operations
- **Upload Data** - Transfer files to volumes
- **Download Data** - Export data from volumes
- **Sync Data** - Synchronize with external storage
- **Archive Data** - Long-term storage solutions

## Storage Performance

### Performance Tiers
- **High Performance SSD** - Low latency, high IOPS
- **Standard SSD** - Balanced performance and cost
- **HDD** - Cost-effective for large datasets

### Optimization Tips
- Choose appropriate storage tier for workload
- Monitor I/O patterns and performance metrics
- Use compression for large datasets
- Implement data lifecycle policies

## Backup and Recovery

### Automated Backups
- Schedule regular volume snapshots
- Configure retention policies
- Monitor backup status and health

### Manual Snapshots
```bash
# Create snapshot
exostellar volume snapshot create volume-name snapshot-name

# List snapshots
exostellar volume snapshot list volume-name

# Restore from snapshot
exostellar volume restore volume-name snapshot-name
```

### Disaster Recovery
- Cross-region replication
- Emergency recovery procedures
- Data integrity verification

## Best Practices

### Planning
- Estimate storage requirements accurately
- Plan for data growth over time
- Consider performance requirements

### Organization
- Use descriptive volume names
- Implement consistent folder structures
- Document data organization schemes

### Security
- Follow data classification policies
- Regular access reviews
- Implement proper backup strategies

### Cost Management
- Monitor storage costs regularly
- Use appropriate storage tiers
- Implement data lifecycle policies

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Volume Mount Failures** - Check permissions and paths
- **Performance Issues** - Monitor I/O patterns and resources
- **Space Issues** - Monitor usage and implement cleanup
