# Workspace Management

Learn how to create, configure, and manage workspaces in the Exostellar platform.

## Overview

Workspaces are containerized development and computing environments that provide isolated, configurable spaces for your work. They include pre-installed software, development tools, and access to storage volumes and compute resources.

## Workspace Concepts

### What is a Workspace?
- Isolated computing environment running in containers
- Pre-configured with software stacks and tools
- Access to shared storage volumes
- Scalable compute resources
- Collaborative features for team work

### Workspace Types
- **Development Workspaces** - Code editing and software development
- **Data Science Workspaces** - Analytics and machine learning
- **Computational Workspaces** - High-performance computing tasks
- **Collaborative Workspaces** - Multi-user shared environments

## Workspace Lifecycle

The typical workspace lifecycle includes:

1. **[Create Workspace](create-workspace.md)** - Set up a new workspace
2. **[Connect to Workspace](connect-to-workspace.md)** - Access and use your workspace
3. **[Monitor Workspace](monitor-workspace.md)** - Track performance and resource usage
4. **[Delete Workspace](delete-workspace.md)** - Clean up when finished

## Key Features

### Development Tools
- Code editors (VS Code, JupyterLab, RStudio)
- Programming language runtimes
- Version control systems
- Debugging and profiling tools

### Compute Resources
- Configurable CPU and memory
- GPU acceleration for AI/ML workloads
- Scalable resource allocation
- Auto-scaling capabilities

### Storage Integration
- Automatic mounting of storage volumes
- Access to shared project data
- Personal and collaborative storage
- Backup and snapshot capabilities

### Networking
- Secure network isolation
- Port forwarding for applications
- Load balancing for high availability
- Integration with external services

## Workspace Templates

### Pre-built Templates
- **Python Data Science** - Jupyter, pandas, scikit-learn
- **R Analytics** - RStudio, R packages, statistical tools
- **Machine Learning** - TensorFlow, PyTorch, GPU support
- **Web Development** - Node.js, React, development servers
- **DevOps** - Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD tools

### Custom Templates
- Create organization-specific templates
- Include proprietary tools and configurations
- Version control for template management
- Sharing templates across teams

## Getting Started

If you're new to workspaces, follow these guides in order:

1. **[Create Workspace](create-workspace.md)** - Learn how to create your first workspace
2. **[Connect to Workspace](connect-workspace.md)** - Access and start using your workspace
3. **[Monitor Workspace](monitor-workspace.md)** - Keep track of resource usage and performance

## Collaboration Features

### Multi-user Access
- Share workspaces with team members
- Real-time collaborative editing
- Role-based access controls
- Session management

### Integration Tools
- Git integration for version control
- Slack/Teams notifications
- Calendar scheduling for shared sessions
- Documentation and wiki integration

## Best Practices

### Resource Management
- Choose appropriate resource allocations
- Monitor usage to optimize costs
- Use auto-shutdown to save resources
- Regular cleanup of unused workspaces

### Security
- Follow organization security policies
- Use strong authentication
- Regular security updates
- Proper data handling practices

### Collaboration
- Establish clear workspace sharing policies
- Use version control for shared code
- Document workspace configurations
- Regular team communication
