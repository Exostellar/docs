# Monitor Workspace

Learn how to monitor workspace performance, resource usage, and health.

## Monitoring Dashboard

### Overview Metrics
- CPU and memory utilization
- Storage usage and I/O performance
- Network traffic and connectivity
- Active sessions and user count

### Real-time Monitoring
- Live resource usage graphs
- Performance alerts and notifications
- System health indicators
- Application status monitoring

## Resource Monitoring

### CPU Usage
```bash
# Check CPU usage
top
htop

# Monitor CPU over time
sar -u 1 10
```

### Memory Usage
```bash
# Check memory usage
free -h
cat /proc/meminfo

# Monitor memory consumption
vmstat 1 10
```

### Storage Monitoring
```bash
# Check disk usage
df -h
du -sh /workspace/*

# Monitor I/O performance
iostat -x 1 10
```

## Application Monitoring

### Jupyter Lab
- Monitor notebook kernel status
- Track cell execution times
- View memory usage per notebook
- Check for hanging processes

### Process Management
```bash
# List running processes
ps aux

# Monitor specific application
pgrep -f application-name

# Kill hung processes
pkill -f process-name
```

## Performance Optimization

### Resource Tuning
- Adjust CPU and memory allocations
- Optimize storage configuration
- Configure network settings
- Enable GPU acceleration when needed

### Application Optimization
- Close unused applications and notebooks
- Clear temporary files and cache
- Optimize code for better performance
- Use efficient data processing techniques

## Alerts and Notifications

### Automatic Alerts
- High resource usage warnings
- Low disk space notifications
- Application crash alerts
- Session timeout reminders

### Custom Monitoring
```bash
# Set up custom alerts
crontab -e

# Example: Check disk usage every hour
0 * * * * df -h | awk '$5 > 80 {print $0}' | mail -s "Disk Usage Alert" user@example.com
```

## Troubleshooting

### Performance Issues
- High CPU usage: Check for runaway processes
- Memory issues: Clear cache and restart applications
- Slow I/O: Monitor disk usage and optimize file operations
- Network problems: Check connectivity and bandwidth

### Application Problems
- Restart hung applications
- Clear browser cache for web-based tools
- Check application logs for errors
- Verify dependencies and configurations

## Best Practices

### Regular Monitoring
- Check resource usage daily
- Set up automated alerts
- Monitor long-running processes
- Review performance trends

### Optimization
- Right-size resources based on actual usage
- Clean up temporary files regularly
- Close unused applications
- Use efficient algorithms and data structures
