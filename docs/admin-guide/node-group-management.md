# Node & Node Group Management

Configure and manage compute resources through node groups in your Exostellar platform.

## Overview

Node groups allow you to organize and manage sets of compute nodes with similar characteristics, enabling efficient resource allocation and workload scheduling.

## Node Group Operations

### Creating Node Groups
- Define node specifications (CPU, memory, storage)
- Configure node group policies and constraints
- Set up auto-scaling parameters

### Managing Node Groups
- Monitor node group health and utilization
- Update node group configurations
- Scale node groups up or down based on demand

### Node Lifecycle Management
- Handle node provisioning and deprovisioning
- Manage node updates and maintenance windows
- Monitor node health and replace unhealthy nodes

## Configuration Options

### Resource Specifications
- CPU and memory allocations
- Storage configuration and types
- Network interface settings

### Scheduling Policies
- Node affinity and anti-affinity rules
- Taints and tolerations
- Resource reservations

## Best Practices

- Group nodes with similar characteristics
- Implement proper monitoring and alerting
- Use auto-scaling to optimize resource utilization
- Plan for maintenance windows and updates
